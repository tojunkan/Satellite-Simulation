Sorry that there are plenty of testing files.
If you want to see the final animation, you can check at the mp4 file in the resporitory.
This is my first project, so there may be many errors, and I actually don't learn how to use github well, So there isn't any structure.
The most mature acheivement maybe the file "Earth-Satellite system-interactive.py".
